This repository is dedicated to an LLM based personal project titled **PharmaConnect**. This project takes in the names of medicines as input from users, processes it and provides a detailed explanation of its active ingredients, uses, side-effects, adverse reactions, potential drug interactions with other medications, foods, or substances, precautions and dosage forms. The answers are provided as text, speech and a text document (with the conversation summary with the bot). It uses _OpenAI API_, _Metaphor API_, _Google's gTTS_ and _Langchain_ to achieve _Text-To-Speech_ and _Text-To-Document_ functionalities. The provided code will automatically deploy this model as a **_Streamlit Application_** .
